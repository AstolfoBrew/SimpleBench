# Simple ┬─┬ Bench

[![Tests](https://github.com/AstolfoBrew/SimpleBench/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AstolfoBrew/SimpleBench/actions/workflows/tests.yml)

A Simple Lua VM Benchmarking Library

### Notice

> Scores may vary depending on the device.<br/>
> Please make sure to, when comparing scores, have all scores ran on the same device.
>
> **SimpleBench does not adjust depending on the current hardware it's being ran on.**

## Compatability

SimpleBench is compatible with Lua 5.1 and upwards.<br/>
It _should_ be compatible with LuaJIT, but thats not included in the tests.<br/>
SimpleBench _is_ compatible with Luau, and therefor _almost_ any Roblox executor.

**SimpleBench is _not_ compatible with Lua 5.0 or below**

## Pre-calculated scores

There are pre-calculated scores for [Luau](out/lua-luau.log), [Lua 5.1](out/lua-5.1.log), [Lua 5.2](out/lua-5.2.log) and [Lua 5.3](out/lua-5.3.log).

## Setting Up

1. Get a Lua Enironment
2. Download SimpleBench ([Stable](https://github.com/AstolfoBrew/SimpleBench/releases/latest) (Recommended), or [Dev Build](https://github.com/AstolfoBrew/SimpleBench/blob/main/SimpleBench.lua))
3. Run SimpleBench in Lua (ie `lua SimpleBench.lua`)
4. Look for the [Final Benchmark Score](https://github.com/AstolfoBrew/SimpleBench/blob/75f4e659bd86e26bfa5a32d3bbc1de5793161442/out/lua-5.3.log#L999) at the end of the output
